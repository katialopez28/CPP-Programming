Coke Machine - Object-Oriented Design


~ How to compile and run programs ~
1. Download all files including: CokeLib.cpp, Code4.cpp, CokeMachine.cpp, and CokeLib.h
2. Download makefile which will compile these 3 files and creates an executable named Code4.e
    Code4.cpp
    CokeMachine.cpp
    CokeLib.cpp


Assumptions:
1. The CokeMachine only dispenses Coke and no other types of items.
2. Payments are entered in pennies - $0.50 is entered as 50, $1.00 is entered as 100.
3. Any displays of change will be in dollars and cents.
4. Any payment entered cannot be used as part of the dispensed change. For example, if the user enter 1234 ($12.54) 
   for payment, then the machine will only dispense a Coke if is has enough change for 1204.
5. When restocking the machine, the entire restock request has to fit. If the entire quantity does not fit, then the restock 
   request is rejected
