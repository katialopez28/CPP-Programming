C++Slam! is our simulation of part of a real board game named Yamslam.

We will simulate rolling 5 dice using a random number generator and our C++ program will determine which dice combination is created by the dice. 
Our player will get the option to reroll the dice to get a different combination. 

The player will be allowed to roll 2 more times. Your program will be looking at seven combinations.

Please read C++ Slam/CPP-Slam.pdf for more information.
